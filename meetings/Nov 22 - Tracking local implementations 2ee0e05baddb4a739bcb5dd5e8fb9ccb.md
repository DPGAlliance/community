- **[KoboToolBox](https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/10267)** - KoboToolbox is a suite of free and open-source tools for field data collection in challenging environments.
- **[Rahat](https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/10092)** - Rahat is a collection of open-source blockchain-based digital relief distribution management projects for humanitarian agencies to support marginalized communities.
- **[ERPNext](https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/10138)** - Open source ERP system for financial accounting, inventory management, etc.

### Key takeaways

**How do you track where and how your DPG is being used?** 

- General analytics (e.g. website visits, forks, etc) can be useful but limited in the information they can provide.
- Have a Discord, Slack, or chat channel open for the developer and implementer community and/or a mailing list and annual meetings.
- Partner channel as a program where they represent local implementations.
- Opt-in self-reporting channels where implementers can submit any use cases and maybe incentivize information flow with an annual report highlighting those who reported.

**Are there any case studies or outstanding examples?**

- ERPNext has 50+ partners implementing partners with a formal relationship with the company.
- Rahat has engaged with 15 local partners and is more involved in implementations.
- OpenMRS annual report → [https://openmrs.org/2021-openmrs-annual-report/](https://openmrs.org/2021-openmrs-annual-report/)

**General recommendations to DPGs:**

- Consider the responsibility of the products and the need to track, sometimes is better to not be able to track implementations by design.
- Tracking who is downloading and who is using the system are two different challenges and knowing if they are using it or not. A user conference where all community members, users, and groups collect learning and people share where they use them. Build a community.
